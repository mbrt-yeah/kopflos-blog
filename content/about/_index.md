Basically, the description says it all. This blog should document my journey to program a headless CMS from scratch.

## Why »kopflos«?

»Kopflos« is a German adjective, with two meanings:

> 1. headless 
> 2. Unable to think clearly or act sensibly due to confusion, surprise, etc.
>

Since I want to program a headless CMS from scratch, the first meaning seems quite fitting to me. The second meaning, on the other hand, is to remind me to proceed in a planned and structured manner during development.

## Me

I am 40 years old and a self-taught programmer working as a systems librarian at a university library.

I can apply and improve my programming skills every now and then at my work work in the context of small projects. I also do a bit of programming in my spare time when time allows.

A self-desciption of my programming skills would look as follows:

- `XSLT`: Upper-intermediate
